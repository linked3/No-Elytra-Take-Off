This datapack not only enhances combat difficulty but also addresses the issue of Elytras being overpowered, preventing easy escape from fights without active engagement.

When wearing an elytra and being hit by skeletons or zombies, you will start limping and won't be able to activate your elytra for 10 seconds. Additionally, you won't be able to perform critical hits during this period. This discourages players from entering battles with their elytra equipped.

Zombies will inflict the Hunger effect with every hit, causing you to lose 3 drumsticks. When you approach creepers, they will slow you down and prevent you from taking off again if you are wearing an elytra. Spiders can now trap you in their cobwebs when attacking.

This datapack is inspired by the mob mechanics found in [True Survival](https://modrinth.com/datapack/true-survival).
